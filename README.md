#### _BlackRock Challenge - Cambridge Hex_

## Inspiration
Small businesses need to use data to empower their decisions and stay afloat. The pandemic made it clear small businesses need to be more diligent about their financial health. Therefore, we were honestly surprised no product exists that interactively evaluates and improves risk in a quick and effective way. We felt compelled to build Fin-Wrapped well because it is an essential tool to bring small businesses to life.

## What it is
Fin-Wrapped is an interactive financial health and risk evaluation dashboard that provides quantitative insights in a simple and easy to use way. We do this by analyzing historical transaction data in order to create a digestible monthly summary.

## What makes our product unique
Unlike most credit score and summary applications, we focus on financial health and lowering risk instead of assessing credit. The point of Fin-Wrapped is to assess and _help_ small businesses. This risk avoidance approach is especially important in the context of a pandemic and other low probability catastrophic events. Additionally, proprietary algorithms can bring the power of BlackRock's financial research to small businesses. 

## Value for BlackRock
Fin-Wrapped provided BlackRock an easy and scalable way to deliver its research infrastructure to small businesses. Deployment would require minimal development overhead due to our well-defined API. All that's needed is to empower our algorithms with their research.

## How we built it
#### Structure
Three-layer web application framework: data layer, logic layer, display layer. Not only is this an effective web-framework, but it also gives rise to a natural distribution of work within our team. Ziyou built the data layer, Kyle and Fernando worked on algorithms in the logic layer, and Saurav implemented the display layer. 

#### Technologies used
- Display layer: `React.js`
- Logic layer: `pandas`, `flask`
- Data layer:  `datastax`, `google-cloud`
- Project managment: GitHub

## What we would have done if we had the time
Our first priority would be to expand the capacity for hypothetical scenario-based analysis. We would then improve the sophistication of our scoring algorithms, projections calculations, and our data simulation techniques. With the refined metrics, we would generate user-tuned action suggestions with AI. 

Additionally, we would like to create more example businesses for product testing, enhance the database to be more user-oriented, and support direct bank account linking. In the fully deployed product, we would provide monthly reports by email.
